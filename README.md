#### [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
The Deep Learning textbook is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free.

#### [Neural Network Design](https://hagan.okstate.edu/NNDesign.pdf)
This book gives an introduction to basic neural network architectures and learning rules. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical analysis of these
networks, on methods of training them and on their application to practical engineering problems in such areas as nonlinear regression, pattern recognition, signal processing, data mining and control systems.
